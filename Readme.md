## Student Queue Management System

This C++ program implements a simple student queue management system where students can 

be enqueued, dequeued, and separated based on their grades.

## Features

Enqueue Students: Add students to the main queue along with their names and grades.

Dequeue Students: Remove students from the selected queue (main, passed, or failed).

Display Queues: View the contents of the main, passed, or failed queues.

Calculate Grades Average: Calculate the average grade of students in a selected queue.

Separate Students: Move students from the main queue to either the passed or failed 

queue based on their grades.

## How to Use

Run the program.

Choose options from the menu to perform different operations.

Follow the prompts to input necessary information like student names, grades, and queue 
selections.

Explore different functionalities such as enqueuing, dequeuing, displaying queues, 
calculating grades average, and separating students.


## Usage

Compile the student_queue.cpp file using a C++ compiler, such as g++, and then execute 

the compiled program to start using the student queue management system.

## bash
Copy code

g++ student_queue.cpp -o student_queue
./student_queue

## Additional Information

The program utilizes structures to represent student data and arrays to manage multiple 
queues.

Separate functions are implemented for queue operations like enqueue, dequeue, display, and average calculation.

Random student IDs are generated for each student using a custom random number generator.

The program allows for the dynamic enqueuing of multiple students at once.
